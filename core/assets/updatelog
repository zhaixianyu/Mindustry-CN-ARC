[cyan]------------------------[v140-11/1]---------------------------
This version can be considered a pre-release. The Erekir campaign is complete, and now has a final sector.
With the release in 10 or so days, all that remains is bugfixes and balancing.

Fixed canvas being available on Serpulo
Fixed RTS AI targeting unreachable locations and thus piling up units more than necessary
Fixed tanks not applying crush damage on servers
Made RTS AI target more structure types

Hosts can now pause in multiplayer (this does not affect headless servers)
Misc unit balance
Decreased cost of T2/3 Erekir cores significantly
:emojis: for blocks in chat now automatically get replaced when typing on desktop (try :router:)
Added new achievements - these have NOT been tested yet, and some will be broken! [Steam]
Added 'rebuild selection' key - holding B (default) and dragging in an area will add ghost blocks to your build queue (Desktop only)
Added a packet rate limit for servers - sending packets too fast will get you blocked/kicked
Added a default max player limit for servers
Added a message block for Erekir (yes it's literally just a recolor, I had no better ideas)
Added a unbreakable message block for mapmakers
Added a keybind to select all units while in command mode (G by default)
Added support for selecting multiple unit factories at once (still no area selection yet)
Stretched out 'landing' sound to sync with core landing - yes, very lazy, I wil make a new one at some point
Increased speed of block constructors slightly
Campaign:

Improved hints for Onset
Reduced research costs for most blocks
Added neoplasm to tech tree
Fixed objectives still continuing after capture
Fixed sectors across Erekir/Serpulo updating or preventing launch when they shouldn't
Added 'abandon' button in pause menu for easier access

Added (WIP) final map completion dialog
Removed Interplanetary Accelerator from Serpulo research (it has no use)

[cyan]------------------------[v139-10/5]---------------------------
v7 is now moving into the beta stage. The campaign system has been (mostly) stabilized, and all that remains in terms of content is approximately 5 more Erekir maps.

Fixed neoplasm being incinerated when contacting slag-bearing blocks

Fixed tank units not working correctly in mods

Fixed ground units moving too "smoothly" around corners

Misc balancing

Made Corvus and Vela no longer stop to shoot when commanded to a target

Made internal 'Canvas' block show up on Erekir - not particularly useful, but some may find it interesting

Made liquid tanks/containers solid and targetable by turrets again

Made mirror filter support increments smaller than 45 degrees (contributed by @hortiSquash)

Made neoplasm slightly more dangerous / spread faster

Removed the 'unit ammo' rule from custom game selection - this rule never worked properly on Erekir, is not balanced, and is seldom used

Improved planet selection UI

Improved item/block selection UI in certain blocks (contributed by @MEEPofFaith)

Added Heat Router block (Code contributed by @l-Luna, sprites by @kapzduke)

Added unit cost multiplier rule (Code partially contributed by @Ilya246)

Misc improvements to AI behavior in "RTS" maps

Mixed tech is now disabled as an option in new maps; the two tech trees are not meant to be used together - no, I will not be changing this back

API change: Made Separator class use a drawer field like GenericCrafter

Added several new maps [Campaign]

Added first-time planet/campaign selection dialog [Campaign]

Made 'global items' of Erekir and Serpulo separate [Campaign]

[cyan]------------------------[v136]---------------------------
The first Erekir build is finally here.

This is a massive update that brings with it an entirely new planet - Erekir - with a completely new tech tree. It would take too long to list all the changes and additions in this build, but here are the highlights:

A new, separate (but incomplete) campaign on the planet Erekir with its own mechanics
100+ new blocks
New units
New items
New factories, turrets, distribution blocks, support structures, etc
New systems for "scripting" maps with logic blocks and objectives
A fog-of-war system, available as a custom map rule and enabled on Erekir
Countless tweaks, improvements and QoL changes
Countless bugfixes... and probably even more new bugs
The old command center and formation mechanics have been replaced with a 'RTS' command system. On desktop, holding [Shift] places you in 'Command Mode', which gives you RTS-like control over your units. Left-click to select groups of units, and right-click to order them to locations or targets.

Note that there is currently no way to RTS-control builder/support units present on Serpulo, like Poly or Mega.

Please keep in mind that the Erekir campaign is still completely unfinished, and covers less than half of the tech tree. While Erekir is nearly completely in terms of block/unit content, most things not covered in the campaign are completely unbalanced, and should be treated as such! Damage/speed/reload/etc values of end-game content are essentially untested placeholder values.

For an introduction to the new systems introduced in this build, play the campaign first. The content added in this update has not been properly tested in custom maps or PvP yet.
